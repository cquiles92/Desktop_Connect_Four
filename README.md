This was a simple application built using Java Swing API. It is the simple game of Connect 4 and uses a grid layout for the board. The game lights up the buttons the game winning row. There is a reset button at the bottom to reset the game board at any point in the game. The game disables functionality (outside of the reset button) once the game is over.
